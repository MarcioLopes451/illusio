  This past weekend marked an exciting milestone for *Illusio*, as we officially
  launched our latest product—the **Hologram Tent**—at the vibrant **Richmond
  Duckpond Market** in London. Saturday, October 19th, will be a day our team
  remembers for many reasons. Despite the early morning's heavy rain, we were
  warmly welcomed by the local traders and the head of the market, and soon
  enough, the sun broke through the clouds, setting the stage for an incredible
  day.


  Our team arrived at the market an hour and a half early to ensure we had ample time to set up. Battling the downpour wasn’t easy, but the excitement in the air—both from us and the other stallholders—was undeniable. Rain or shine, the community was eager to share their creations, and we were ready to introduce something entirely new: an immersive holographic experience.


  As the skies cleared and the sun began to shine, so too did the crowd start to gather. Families, couples, and curious onlookers of all ages wandered through the market, exploring the unique stalls. We were eager but nervous—this was our first public showcase, and we weren’t sure what to expect.


  The first hour was a learning curve. We had to find our rhythm in engaging passersby and explaining what the Hologram Tent was all about. Without the bold colors and flashy displays that some of the other stalls had, we relied on curiosity and word-of-mouth to draw people in. It took time for people to stop and take notice, but once they did, we began to see their smiles light up.


  Once inside, visitors were captivated by the holographic displays—a futuristic experience unlike anything else at the market. Despite initial hesitations, especially as we didn’t have a huge budget for marketing, word quickly spread. As soon as the first few visitors entered and saw the stunning holograms, their excitement became contagious.


  Over the course of the next five hours, we stood proudly at our stall, greeting guests, sharing stories, and showcasing our vision. It wasn’t just about selling a product, but offering a moment of wonder—a new way of seeing the world, even if just for a few minutes inside our tent. By the end of the day, we felt a sense of accomplishment that far outweighed the challenges we’d faced earlier.

  ### Lessons Learned:


  1﻿. **Improve Blackout Efficiency**\

  Our tent didn’t block out enough light, which affected the quality of the holographic displays. For future events, we’ll need to improve the tent’s blackout capabilities by either modifying the materials or adding extra layers to create a darker environment inside.


  2﻿. **Height Wasn't a Big Concern**\

  We initially thought the TV supporting the plexiglass needed to be at eye level for optimal viewing, but this wasn't the case. The screen can be positioned lower, as long as it’s properly barricaded to block the viewer's line of sight to the edges of the screen. This flexibility opens up more possibilities for how we set up the tent in the future.


  3﻿. **Setup Takes Longer Than Expected**\

  We underestimated how long it would take to assemble the tent. We aimed to start by 11:00 AM but weren’t ready until 11:45. This lost us valuable time, especially with only a five-hour window. We’ll practice assembly beforehand to improve our efficiency and make sure we start on time.


  4﻿. **Be ready to improvise!**\

  On the day, things didn’t go exactly as planned—whether it was technical issues or needing to tweak our sales pitch. Being able to adapt quickly and keep going was critical, and this experience taught us the importance of staying flexible and finding creative solutions on the fly.
