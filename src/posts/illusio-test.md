firstParagraph: "Hello dear reader and welcome to the illusio blog! I'm so
  excited to finally launch this project that's been brewing in my mind for
  almost 10 years now. Whether you stumbled upon this site by chance or came
  here intentionally, I'm thrilled to have you along for the ride. My name is
  Henrique and I’m the founder of illusio. This blog will be a place for me to
  share my insights into the business - whether it’s a new discovery relating to
  the technology side, progression within the company or all the inspiring
  stories that will hopefully come from this journey.  "

secondParagraph: This week we have officially launched the website and
  illusio.co.uk is now up and running! Our next plan is to bring the magic of
  holograms to the vibrant street markets of London. Imagine stumbling upon a
  bustling market stall, only to be greeted by a lifelike holographic figure
  showcasing our latest creations. We're excited to reimagine how technology and
  everyday life intersect, and we invite you to join us on this exciting journey
  as we bring the future of holograms to life!
